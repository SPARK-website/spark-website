                    <li>Apply something cold to the area, such as an ice pack, for 10-15 minutes to reduce swelling.</li>

                    <li>Leave as much DNA as possible. If you are in a vehicle, touch as many places as you can to leave your fingerprints. Also, try getting the assailant's DNA on you; this will help when you report the incident later.</li>
                    <li>Observe your surroundings and look for any landmarks that can help you report the incident to authorities.</li>
                    <li>Stay calm and try humanizing yourself to the criminal.</li>
                    <li>Try to vomit or spit on the assailant; this might help loosen their grip on you.</li>
                    <li>Call or signal for help ASAP.</li>
                    <li>Try your best not to get into a vehicle with the kidnapper. Your chances of escape reduce when you are in a contained space where they can control you.</li>
                    <li>If in a vehicle, look for any escape opportunities (doors, windows, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Make noise to attract attention.</li>
                    <li>Thankfully, kidnapping is not as common now as it once was, but it is still a very serious issue, so make sure to stay prepared.</li>

                    <li>This is quite obvious, but still a very important rule. Do NOT click on suspicious links or download suspicious files. These attachments could contain viruses, worms, or other malware.</li>
                    <li>Only accept friend requests from people you know on social media. I'm sure everyone wants to have like a million followers on social media, but if you have an account on which you want to have thousands of followers, don't post personal things on it. Create a separate, private account that is only followed by people you know.</li>
                    <li>Last, but not least, if anyone, and I mean ANYONE (this includes friends and family), is harassing you or troubling you online, immediately block and report them. If you can, also report this to a trusted adult. Harassment is no joke, and is a very serious matter.</li>
