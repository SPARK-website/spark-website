                <li>There are many methods to ground yourself during a panic attack. Some of these methods are:
                    <ul class="nested-list">
                        <li><strong>5-4-3-2-1 method:</strong> Notice 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, and 1 that you taste.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deep breathing:</strong> Inhale for 4 counts, hold your breath for 4, and then exhale for 4 counts. Repeat until you feel calm.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use your senses:</strong> Hold an object and try to notice its weight, texture, and temperature.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
