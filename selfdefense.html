            <h2>Using everyday objects to defend yourself:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hold your keys in between your fingers and slash or jab anyone who tries to attack.</li>
                <li>Use perfume, pepper spray, sanitizer, etc., and spray it into the eyes of the assailant.</li>
                <li>Use your bag or backpack to swing and create distance between you and the assailant.</li>
                <li>Use water bottles or thermos bottles to swing at the attacker and aim for hands, arms, or shins.</li>
                <li>Do not try to fight; run as fast as you can when you get a clear opportunity to.</li>

            <h2>If someone is following you:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay calm and alert, and keep looking around.</li>
                <li>Change direction and see if they are actually following you.</li>
                <li>Go to busy places that are filled with people.</li>
                <li>Call someone and let a friend or relative know your location.</li>
                <li>Avoid shortcuts and stick to well-lit, crowded places.</li>
                <li>Get to safety, but do not confront them.</li>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How to escape holds and grabs:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Make as much noise as possible to draw attention and make it clear that you are resisting the hold.</li>
                <li>Aim for sensitive areas like eyes, throat, nose, knees, and groin.</li>
                <li>Use your body weight and twist, drop, or push off to break their grip.</li>
                <li>Use objects around you like keys, a water bottle, bags, etc.</li>
                <li>As soon as you are free of their grip, run away as fast as you can, and do NOT look back.</li>
                <li>Once you are in a safe location, call for help immediately (it can be friends, family, the police, or emergency services).</li>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What to do in case of a kidnapping:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Leave as much DNA as possible. If you are in a vehicle, touch as many places as you can to leave your fingerprints. Also, try getting the assailant's DNA on you; this will help when you report the incident later.</li>
                <li>Observe your surroundings and look for any landmarks that can help you report the incident to authorities.</li>
                <li>Stay calm and try humanizing yourself to the criminal.</li>
                <li>Try to vomit or spit on the assailant; this might help loosen their grip on you.</li>
                <li>Call or signal for help ASAP.</li>
                <li>Try your best not to get into a vehicle with the kidnapper. Your chances of escape reduce when you are in a contained space where they can control you.</li>
                <li>If in a vehicle, look for any escape opportunities (doors, windows, etc.).</li>
                <li>Make noise to attract attention.</li>
                <li>Thankfully, kidnapping is not as common now as it once was, but it is still a very serious issue, so make sure to stay prepared.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Keep essentials like your phone, keys, a whistle, and safety spray in easy reach.</li>
                <li>Stick to well-lit and crowded routes, avoid shortcuts, and always inform someone where you are going.</li>
                <li>Trust your instincts.</li>
                <li>Speak up clearly if someone is invading your personal space or making you feel unsafe.</li>
